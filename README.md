# Chime-In
## A Simple user feedback app aimed at dispersed teams.

Chime-In is an SMS user feedback app powered by Twilio, Postgres, React/Redux, Express and Graph.js.  You can see it in action [here](https://mighty-depths-52749.herokuapp.com/)!

### What does it do?
Send phone messages to users and get feedback.
Create a user using the form.  That user is sent a  message asking to confirm whether they wish to be sent messages.  Until they respond yes, you can't send them anything.  Once they do, you can compose questions and gather responses.  Once they are in, they are graphed under a drop-down to show how people answered.

### Tech Stack
Mostly it comes down to Postgres and Twilio.  React, Redux and Graph.js are used to make the visuals, and Express is used to serve the backend and static app.
